            <p>The distinction between <em>Hatha yoga</em> and <em>asana</em> is that <strong>asana</strong> specifically refers to the physical postures practiced in yoga, while <strong>Hatha yoga</strong> is a branch of yoga that that incorporates asanas among its many practices. The practice of asanas is believed to have originated in ancient India and can be traced back to the <span class="hint" data-tooltip="an ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns. It is one of the four sacred canonical Hindu texts known as the Vedas.">Rigveda</span>, an ancient Hindu scripture dating back to around 1500 BCE.</p>

            <p><span class="hint" data-tooltip="also called Gonardiya or Gonikaputra, a Hindu author, mystic and philosopher">Patanjali</span> in his <span class="hint" data-tooltip="a collection of Sanskrit sutras (aphorisms) on the theory and practice of yoga">Yoga Sutras</span>, written around 400 CE, describes asana practice as the third of the eight limbs (Sanskrit: अष्टाङ्ग, aṣṭāṅga, from अष्ट् aṣṭ, eight, and अङ्ग aṅga, limb) of classical, or raja yoga. While the Yoga Sutras do not mention any asanas by name, they provide guidelines for the physical practice of asanas, emphasizing their role in purifying the body and preparing it for meditation.</p>

          <h3>Benefits of asanas</h3>

        <div class="item text">
          <div>
            <p>Medieval hatha yoga texts touted the dual benefits of spiritual and physical gains from asanas. In recent years, numerous scientific studies have also shown the therapeutic effects of yoga asanas on various health conditions, such as chronic pain, hypertension, and depression, while enhancing cardiovascular health, respiratory function, and overall quality of life. Regular practice of asanas can help increase flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as circulation, digestion, and immune function.</p>

            <p>Asanas can also be modified to suit different ages, abilities, and physical limitations, making it an accessible form of exercise for people of all backgrounds and fitness levels.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Each pose is done in sync with the breath, like the <span class="hint" data-tooltip="deep breathing through the nose, while slightly contracting the back of the throat, creating a hissing sound">Ujjayi breath</span>, making them more than just physical exercises. By incorporating breathing techniques and focus, asanas could serve as a gateway to deeper states of consciousness. Through asana practice, we learn to quiet the mind and cultivate a sense of inner peace. This inner peace can lead to a greater awareness of our true nature and the interconnectedness of all things.</p>

            <p>So, strike a pose, and let the good times roll!</p>
