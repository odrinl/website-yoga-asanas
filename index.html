                  The distinction between <em>Hatha yoga</em> and
                  <em>asana</em> is that <strong>asana</strong> specifically
                  refers to the physical postures practiced in yoga, while
                  <strong>Hatha yoga</strong> is a branch of yoga that that
                  incorporates asanas among its many practices. The practice of
                  asanas is believed to have originated in ancient India and can
                  be traced back to the

                  अष्ट् aṣṭ, eight, and अङ्ग aṅga, limb) of classical, or raja
                  yoga. While the Yoga Sutras do not mention any asanas by name,
                  they provide guidelines for the physical practice of asanas,
                  emphasizing their role in purifying the body and preparing it
                  for meditation.

                  of years. Today, with the growth of popularity of yoga
                  worldwide, asanas continue to be an integral part of modern
                  yoga practice and are widely recognized for their numerous
                  health benefits.

                  Medieval hatha yoga texts touted the dual benefits of
                  spiritual and physical gains from asanas. In recent years,
                  numerous scientific studies have also shown the therapeutic
                  effects of yoga asanas on various health conditions, such as
                  chronic pain, hypertension, and depression, while enhancing
                  cardiovascular health, respiratory function, and overall
                  quality of life. Regular practice of asanas can help increase
                  flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as circulation,
                  digestion, and immune function.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Asanas can also be modified to suit different ages, abilities,
                  and physical limitations, making it an accessible form of
                  exercise for people of all backgrounds and fitness levels.

                  Each pose is done in sync with the breath, like the

                    >Ujjayi breath</span
                  >, making them more than just physical exercises. By
                  incorporating breathing techniques and focus, asanas could
                  serve as a gateway to deeper states of consciousness. Through
                  asana practice, we learn to quiet the mind and cultivate a
                  sense of inner peace. This inner peace can lead to a greater
                  awareness of our true nature and the interconnectedness of all
                  things.

            <p>
              Headstand, or Sirsasana in Sanskrit, is an advanced yoga pose that
              involves balancing the body on the head and forearms. To come into
              the pose, start in a kneeling position and place your forearms on
              the ground, interlacing your fingers. Place the crown of your head
              on the ground between your palms, and slowly straighten your legs,
              lifting them up towards the ceiling. Engage your core muscles to
              keep your body in a straight line, and breathe deeply. Headstand
              is often considered the "king" of all yoga poses, and it requires
              strength, balance, and concentration.

            <p>
              An inverted yoga pose that involves lifting your entire body up
              with your shoulders as the base of support. To come into the pose,
              start by lying on your back with your arms at your sides. Lift
              your legs up towards the ceiling, then place your hands on your
              lower back for support as you lift your hips off the ground. Bring
              your legs up and over your head, keeping your hands on your back
              for support, until your toes touch the ground behind your head.
              Straighten your legs and engage your core muscles to hold the
              pose, and breathe deeply. Shoulderstand is often practiced as part
              of a larger sequence of yoga poses.

            <p>
              A gentle yoga pose that involves moving the spine through two
              opposing positions. To come into the pose, start on your hands and
              knees with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your
              knees under your hips. Inhale as you arch your spine, lifting your
              head and tailbone towards the ceiling and allowing your belly to
              sink towards the ground - this is the cow pose (Bitilasana).
              Exhale as you round your spine, tucking your chin to your chest
              and bringing your tailbone towards your knees - this is the cat
              pose (Marjaryasana). Move slowly and smoothly between these two
              poses, coordinating each movement with your breath. Cat-Cow
              Stretch is often used as a warm-up or a gentle movement to help
              relieve tension in the spine, improve flexibility, and increase
              mindfulness.

            <p>
              An inverted yoga pose that involves folding the body in half and
              bringing the feet over the head. To come into the pose, start by
              lying on your back with your arms at your sides. Lift your legs up
              towards the ceiling, then slowly lower them over your head until
              your toes touch the ground behind you. Keep your hands on your
              lower back for support, and breathe deeply as you hold the pose.
              Plough pose is a challenging posture that requires flexibility in
              the back, hamstrings, and shoulders, as well as strength in the
              core and legs.

            <p>
              A foundational yoga pose that involves stretching the entire body,
              especially the hamstrings, calves, and spine. To come into the
              pose, start on your hands and knees with your wrists directly
              under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Spread your
              fingers wide and press into your hands as you lift your hips up
              and back, straightening your arms and legs and forming an inverted
              "V" shape with your body. Keep your head and neck relaxed, and
              gaze towards your feet or your navel. Downward Facing Dog is often
              used as a resting pose or a transitional pose between other yoga
              postures.

              legs, stretching the entire back of the body from the heels to the
              crown of the head. To come into the pose, sit on the floor with
              your legs extended straight out in front of you. Inhale to
              lengthen your spine, then exhale to fold forward from the hips,
              reaching your hands towards your feet or ankles. Keep your knees
              straight and your spine long, and breathe deeply as you hold the
              pose. Sitting Forward Bend is a calming posture that can help
              relieve stress and anxiety, as well as improve digestion and
              stimulate the internal organs.

              your elbows close to your sides. Look up towards the ceiling or
              sky, keeping your shoulders relaxed and your gaze soft. Cobra pose
